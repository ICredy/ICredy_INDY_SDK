    "keywords": "Namespaces The Indy SDK wrapper for .NET is separated into a series of namespaces that contain types for performing specific types of interactions. The list of these namespaces and their function can be found below and the you can access the types can be accessed by selecting the namespace from the sidebar. Hyperledger.Indy General types that relate to the .NET wrapper as a whole. This includes exception types that are common to all interactions. See the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy> Namespace topic for details. Hyperledger.Indy.AnonCredsApi Types for generating and managing anonymous credentials including claims, claim schema, proofs, etc. See the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy.AnonCredsApi> Namespace topic for details. Hyperledger.Indy.BlobStorageApi Types for reading and writing Binary Large OBjects to and from storage. See the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy.BlobStorageApi> Namespace topic for details. Hyperledger.Indy.CryptoApi Types for performing common pure cryptographic functions that are not specific to the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy.DidApi.Did> functionality such as generating key-pairs, signing, verifying and anonymous encryption. See the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy.CryptoApi> Namespace topic for details. Hyperledger.Indy.DidApi Types for creating and managing DIDs, key management, encryption, decryption, digital signatures, etc. See the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy.DidApi> Namespace topic for details. Hyperledger.Indy.LedgerApi Types for generating transaction messages as well as signing and sending them to a ledger pool. See the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy.LedgerApi> Namespace topic for details. Hyperledger.Indy.PairwiseApi Types for managing pairwise relationships between DIDs. See the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy.PairwiseApi> Namespace topic for details. Hyperledger.Indy.PoolApi Types for managing connections to node pools that host ledgers. See the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy.PoolApi> Namespace topic for details. Hyperledger.Indy.WalletApi Types for managing wallets which can contain DIDs, their associated keys and other key/value data. See the <xref:Hyperledger.Indy.WalletApi> Namespace topic for details."

    "keywords": ".NET API for the Hyperledger Indy SDK The .NET API for the Hyperledger Indy SDK can be used with any flavor of .NET that conforms to the .NET Standard 1.0 and above including but not limited to the .NET Framework v4.5 and .NET Core 1.0 and can be used on any platform with .NET support. The .NET assembly is a wrapper for the C-callable Indy SDK which must be installed separately in an appropriate location (e.g. the DLL search path in Windows). The SDK provides features for managing a self sovereign identity including communication between agents, storing and managing keys and data, generation of claims, claim requests, proofs and other anonymous credentials, cryptographic functionality and generation of messages for interacting with an Indy node pool such as the one hosting the Sovrin ledger. For more information on Hyperledger Indy see the Hyperledger website The source code for the Hyperledger Indy SDK, including this .NET wrapper can be found here For more information on Sovrin see the Sovrin website To dive in and start coding please proceed to the API Documentation ."
